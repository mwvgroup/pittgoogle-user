<insert description. what is in this repo, and what can people do with it?>

<insert instructions needed to use this code from scratch. here is an outline>

1.  Setup a Google Cloud Project
    -   <link to basic instructions in broker docs. this should include the following>
        -   create the project
        -   create a service account for yourself and download and key file with credentials
        -   install `gcloud` SDK locally
    -   <instructions for more detailed setup. we will provide a script they can run for this, including things like enabling APIs and giving various service accounts appropriate permissions. I have started one at [project-setup.sh](project-setup.sh), though ultimately we probably want to use something like Workflows instead of a shell script.>
