# One-Time Setup for Cloud Run

First, follow the [one-time setup](https://mwvgroup.github.io/pittgoogle-client/one-time-setup.html) instructions to install the pittgoogle-client package and setup authentication to a Google Cloud project.
You can skip the step that enables APIs, but you will need to install the command-line tools.

Then, run the script [one-time-setup-for-cloud-run.sh](one-time-setup-for-cloud-run.sh) that is in this directory.
Example code is given below.

```bash
bash one-time-setup-for-cloud-run.sh  # [FIXME]
```
