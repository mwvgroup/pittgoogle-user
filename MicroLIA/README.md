# MicroLIA Classifier

This Cloud Run instance classifies alerts using
[MicroLIA](https://microlia.readthedocs.io/)

The code follows MicroLIA's OGLE IV example(https://microlia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/Examples.html#example-ogle-iv).

The trained model is packaged here in 'trained_model' for use with the Cloud Function.
